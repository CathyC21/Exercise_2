# Exercise_2
Redraw a cropped section of Kandinsky's Composition 8

Exercise 2: Redraw Crop from Kandinsky's Composition 8 (see basecamp). First select an interesting/ambitious crop, then load it into a program such as Photoshop or Illustrator to read the color and coordinate data. Use integer values for coordinates and use the following functions for drawing: line(), triangle(), quad(), rect(), ellipse(), arc(), and beginShape(), endShape(), vertex(). Focus on color, using the color picker in Adobe to get the RGB & HSB values.  

Note that by passsing a 4th value to Fill() - ie, fill(255, 0, 0, 255) - will control the alpha channel, otherwise known as opacity. Full opacity will be 255. Being completely transparent will be 0. See the [color tutorial on Processing's website](https://www.processing.org/tutorials/color/) for information about transparency. Also [note that color can also be a data type](https://processing.org/reference/color_datatype.html)

We'll cover how to do gradients in class next week.
